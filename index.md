## Introduction

Focus is an automatic time-tracking software which helps you keep track of what you do.

It's an attempt to replace and improve existing services like RescueTime, ManicTime, WakaTime and others. It is different in that it's completely open source, extendable, and you as a user have full and exclusive control over your data.

### About Focus

Focus is about recording our digital lives, an evergrowing part of our lives in general, and the new opportunities enabled by such a record.

By running Focus on your devices you can collect data about what you do which you can use for a variety of use cases:

- Record what you do in life.
- Learn about what you do and how much you do it. See which applications you use, websites you visit, videos you watch, music you listen to and games you play.
- Estimate productivity by measuring how much time you spend actually getting stuff done.
